However, unlike $ZFRAME, $ZLINE can be defined  more than once. This allows an arbitrary number of curves to be plotted  on the frame. Keep in mind that any variable not redefined by a subsequent  $ZLINE namelist retains its value from the previous $ZLINE namelist.  Although some inputs are double precision, they are ultimately converted  to single precision. The value of double precision inputs comes to light  when the TX or TY inputs are used to difference 2 very close double   precision numbers. For example, X = KX * X + TX, when TX ~= -X. In this  case, the computed difference will have many more significant digits  than if the difference was computed using single precision operands.  Also, $ZLINE can be used to write a text string using the PGPLOT routine  PGPTEXT as: CALL PGPTEXT( XTXT , YTXT , ANGLE , FJUST , TEXT ).  Name    Type   Dim   Default   Units   Description  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ANGLE      R     1       0.0     deg   angle at which to write TEXT,                                          counterclockwise from x-axis  CH         R     1       .75       -   PGPLOT character height of TEXT  CI         I     1         2       -   PGPLOT color index for line and TEXT  FJUST      R     1       0.0       -   horizontal justification for TEXT.                                         If FJUST is 0.0, then TEXT is left                                         justified.
