# GTARG
Ground Track Targeting Program

GTARG was used to design orbit maintenanace maneuvers for the TOPEX/POSEIDON program for NASAJPL during
the 1990s. The goal was to maintain an exact repeat ground track to within one kilometer and approximately
a 10 day repeat. GTARG was a preliminary targeting program; the more detailed JPL software was used
for final burn calculation before each maneuver.

For details see the 1993 AIAA paper, which gives the detailed alogorithm actually implemented.
