It creates the function subroutine LNKTIM.  TheC	function LNKTIM then provides the link time when it is call by the mainC	 program.C	 For example, CC		(1) Edit the program test.forC				program testC				:C				character*24 x, lnktimC				external lnktimC				:C				:C				x = lnktim()C				print *, 'Test created at ',xC				:C				:C				stopC				endCC		(2) Compile and link as follows:CC				FOR TESTC				FOR LINKTIMEC				LINK LINKTIMEC				RUN LINKTIMEC				LINK TEST, LNKTIMCC		(3) when the program TEST is executed, the lineC			C			Test created at 4-JUL-1776 12:00:00C	C		    will be printed out.CC		NOTE: THIS program, LINKTIME, is not actually linked with theC			main program.  It is an independent program whichC			is compiled and executed at linkage of the main program.C			The subroutine LNKTIM which is created by  LINKTIMEC			is what is really used!!.CC		CREATION LOG:		created by UNKNOWN AUTHOR C					at an UNKNOWN TIMEC					in an UNKNOWN PLACEC				      character*8 timebuf      character*9 datebuf      call DATE(datebuf)      call TIME(timebuf)      open(unit=10,name='lnktim.f',status='NEW')      write(10,*) '       FUNCTION LNKTIM()'      write(10,*) '       CHARACTER*(*) LNKTIM'      write(10,100) datebuf, timebuf 100  format('        LNKTIM = ''',A9,1x,a8,'''')      write(10,*) '       END'      close(10)      write(6,*)'Link Time is ',datebuf,' ',timebuf      end
